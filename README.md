# Paparazzi [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/Sidereo/Paparazzi.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/Sidereo/Paparazzi) [![Version](https://api.bintray.com/packages/sidereo/maven/Paparazzi/images/download.svg)](https://bintray.com/sidereo/maven/Paparazzi/_latestVersion)

Do you need to include a picture picker in your activity?

Like a horizontal list of recent pictures and the possibility to open the camera/gallery?

###**BOOM! That's what paparazzi does.**
(the top part is Paparazzi, the bottom part is just an imageview)


## Usage

```xml

  <com.sidereo.paparazzi.view.Paparazzi
    paparazzi:paparazzi__pictureNumber="40"
    paparazzi:paparazzi__type="grid" // or list
    paparazzi:paparazzi__columns="3" // if using grid
    android:id="@+id/paparazzi"
    android:clipToPadding="false"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="100dp"/>


```

When you're done, get the View into a variable and then:

```java
paparazzi.prepare(this).disableCamera().disableGallery().shoot();

```

`this` here is an `Activity` implementing `Redaction`

`disableCamera()` & `disableGallery()` are obviously optional, in case you don't want to open the camera or the gallery.


## Dependency

**Gradle**
```groovy
compile 'com.sidereo:paparazzi:1.1.0'
```
**Maven**

```
Who uses that? Seriously.
```
