# Paparazzi

Do you need to include a picture picker in your activity?

Like a horizontal list of recent pictures and the possibility to open the camera/gallery?

###**BOOM! That's what paparazzi does.**
(the top part is Paparazzi, the bottom part is just an imageview)


## Usage

```xml

  <com.sidereo.paparazzi.view.Paparazzi
    paparazzi:paparazzi__pictureNumber="40"
    android:id="@+id/paparazzi"
    android:clipToPadding="false"
    android:layout_width="match_parent"
    android:layout_height="100dp"/>


```
Of course, you can customize `paparazzi:paparazzi__pictureNumber` value to fit your needs ;)

When you're done, get the View into a variable and then:

```java
paparazzi.prepare(this).disableCamera().disableGallery().shoot();

```

`this` here is an `Activity` implementing `Redaction`

`disableCamera()` & `disableGallery()` are obviously optional, in case you don't want to open the camera or the gallery.


## Dependency

**Gradle**
```groovy
compile 'com.sidereo:paparazzi:1.0.0'
```
**Maven**

```
Who uses that? Seriously.
```
